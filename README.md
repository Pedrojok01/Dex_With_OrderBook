Decentralized exchange written in solidity for the Ethereum Network, and part of the programming course: Ethereum201 on [academy.ivanontech.com](https://academy.ivanontech.com/).


## Installation

Make sure you have the following ready:
- `npm` installed
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs) installed globally via `npm install -g truffle` (developped on v5.3.2).
- Cloned the repo via `git clone`

## Deployment

In your terminal, go to the DEX repo and type:
`cd blockchain`
`npm install`

To deploy your smart-contracts:

PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A PROTOTYPE. WHILE IT IS WORKING FINE, THIS DEX IS NOT READY TO GO LIVE YET.
- Run `truffle develop`, then `test` to make sure everything is running smoothly.
- Run `truffle migrate --network <<network name here>>` to deploy to the network of your choice. So for Kovan, type `truffle migrate --network kovan`

## Client

I might add a frond-end in the near future. In the meantime, feel free to contribute and/or build it yourself.
